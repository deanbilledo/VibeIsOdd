# About VibeIsOdd

VibeIsOdd is a satirical, AI-powered Python package that determines if a number is oddâ€”by asking a large language model instead of using math. Originally built for OpenAI GPT, it can be extended to use other LLMs like Gemini. The project pokes fun at the trend of using AI for trivial tasks, while still being a fully functional, production-quality package.

- **Purpose:** Parody, fun, and a demonstration of modern Python packaging and AI API usage.
- **Features:**
  - Uses LLMs to answer "Is this number odd?"
  - Batch processing
  - Custom exceptions and error handling
  - Support for multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Gemini, etc.)
  - Clean, well-documented code
